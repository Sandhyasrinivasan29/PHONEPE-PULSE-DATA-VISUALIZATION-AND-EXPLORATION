# PHONEPE-PULSE-DATA-VISUALIZATION-AND-EXPLORATION
Millions of customers in India rely on PhonePe, one of the most widely used digital payment services, for daily transactions. The app is renowned for its simple of use, quick and safe payment processing, and straightforward design. Additionally, it has received numerous honors and recognitions for its cutting-edge features and contributions to the digital payments sector.

In order to analyze Phonepe transactions and users based on different years, quarters, states, and transaction types,I develop a web application. Based on the requirements, we provide a  Geovisualization, Bar graph and pie graph  results. And also i have included some questions to know about the insights.

Approach:
1. Data extraction: Using scripting, clone the Github repository for Phonepe Pulse and retrieve the data. Store the data in an appropriate format, like CSV or JSON.
2. Data transformation: To manipulate and pre-process the data, use a scripting language like Python and packages like Pandas. This could entail preparing missing numbers, cleaning the data, and formatting it so that it can be used for analysis and visualization.
3. Database insertion: Connect to a MySQL database using Python's "mysql-connector-python" module, then use SQL commands to insert the converted data.
4. Dashboard creation: To construct an interactive and eye-catching dashboard, use the Python packages Streamlit and Plotly. The data may be shown on a map using Plotly's built-in geolocation features, and Streamlit can be used to make an intuitive user interface with several dropdown menus so that users can choose which facts and figures to show.
5. Data retrieval: To connect to a MySQL database and retrieve data into a Pandas dataframe, use the "mysql-connector-python" module. To dynamically refresh the dashboard, use the data in the dataframe.
6. Deployment: Make sure the system is effective, safe, and intuitive to use. After doing a comprehensive test of the solution, make the dashboard publicly available so that users can view it.

Technology Stack Used:
1.Python
2.MySQL
